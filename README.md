# Pose Detection in the Browser With Tensorflow js 

This is made, partly to learn Posenet, partly in response to the [In My Feelings Challenge AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prswDGGmYaE)

Code for the most part is directly from [here] (https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/posenet), the fabulous tfjs-models repo.

Modified to use Vue js.
